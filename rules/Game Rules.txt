RULES:
1. You must create characters that would fit in a game as Toony as this. I don't think a naked person would fit quite right...

2. All characters (including hired Champions) will start at Level 1 with 20 HP and 50 MP. You must keep track of your health and magic, otherwise you could be in trouble!

3. Make sure you don't try to be better than anyone else. Also, don't try to control other players' characters. It's called powerplay and godmodding, respectively.

4. As you go through the game's worlds, make sure you pay attention to Terrain Bonuses. This type of information is crucial to your survival.

5. When you battle, you must have a minimum Party of 4 characters. Also, up to 6 characters can be in a Party at one time. As you build your collection, you might need to swap your characters from time to time.

6. Most importantly, have fun! (Follow the above rules, and this should be no problem!)
